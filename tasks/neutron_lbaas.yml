# These tasks are here to handle a situation where a deployer has v1 deployed
# and then chooses to deploy v2 (or vice versa). The existing tasks within
# neutron_upstart_init.yml will deploy configuration files for both agents
# and both will be running on the system until these tasks run.
#
# These tasks will ensure that the correct agent is the only one running.
